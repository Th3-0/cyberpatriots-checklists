# cyberpatriots-checklists
This is all of the custom cyberpatriots resources that I use for competition.

Windows-Checklist:
    The windows checklist is a very basic windows checklist for cyberpatriots, it has not been customized with things found from competition as I did not use windows
Ubunut Checklist:
    The ubuntu checklist has much more useful info and commands
    It has been changed and improved each competition.
UserManager.sh
    This has two functions. The first being removing removing users that shouldn't be on the system and adding them vice versa. For this funciton you must manually name the users from the readme-I'm trying to improve this but haven't had the time.
    Function 2 is changing passwords for all users but root and the main cyperpatriot user. *Note that the main cyberpatriot user must be named manually
prohibitedPrograms.sh
    pretty self explanatory, uses dpkg to search for bad programs *NOTE: is not scanning for malware, only things like nmap. Also does not delete automatically
Ubuntu.sh
    This script taks both of the above scripts and combines them into one allong with a bunch of other small tools. Good baseline to run after completeing forensics questions.
